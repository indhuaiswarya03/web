A hut roof is the covering of a small, simple dwelling, often built with readily available, local materials using traditional techniques. Common hut roof types include thatched roofs, made from grasses, straw, or leaves for natural insulation, and roofs made of other materials like bamboo, wood, mud, or even modern materials like plywood and metal sheets, depending on the local resources and design</p>
