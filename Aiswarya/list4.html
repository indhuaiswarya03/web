A tree is a tall, long-lived, woody plant with a single main trunk that supports branches and leaves, and an underground root system. Its woody trunk provides support and longevity, while the roots anchor it in the soil, absorbing water and nutrients. Trees are vital for the planet, producing oxygen, cleaning the air, preventing soil erosion, and providing food and shelter for wildlife.</h3></p></i>
