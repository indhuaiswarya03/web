A fruit is the mature, seed-bearing part of a flowering plant, developing from the plant's ovary after fertilization. While commonly thought of as sweet and fleshy, like apples or grapes, the botanical definition is broader and includes various plant products, such as cucumbers, tomatoes, and even nuts and grains. Fruits serve to protect and disperse the seeds, often by attracting animals to eat them.
