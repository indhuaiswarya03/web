A vegetable is a generally herbaceous, edible part of a plant, such as leaves, stems, roots, flowers, or seeds, which is consumed as food, typically in savory dishes. While botanically, a fruit develops from the flower's ovary and contains seeds, the term "vegetable" is primarily a culinary one, encompassing plant parts eaten for their nutritional value, including those that are botanically fruits, like tomatoes and peppers.</h3></p></i>
