A flower is a beautiful, often fragrant and colorful, part of a flowering plant (angiosperm) that serves as its reproductive structure, containing the parts that produce pollen and seeds. Flowers attract pollinators like bees and insects with their petals and nectar, facilitating the creation of new plants. Key parts include the protective sepals, the colorful petals, the male stamens (anther and filament), and the female carpel (stigma, style, and ovary).
